        <h2> <a href="https://www.starbucks.com/">  Starbucks </a></h2>
      
        <p>
        In my opinion, the Starbucks website is very well done and easy to navigate. When I think of Starbucks, their logo comes to mind and the deep color of green they use that is also used throughout the website. Their website has a modern feel to it and it is very easy to be able to find what you are looking for. The sidebar menu gives you the option to look through the menu, rewards, and gift cards. You are able to sign in to your account, join the Starbucks club, and find a store near you. 
            The code is definitely clean and modern. They do use HTML5 elements such as the body and div. In the code, I do not see tables that are used.
            The layout of the Starbucks website makes sense to me and is easy to follow. When the website would be pulled up on a computer, the menu and other navigational contents are up along the top bar, making it easy to find what you are looking for. When it is smaller, like if you were using the website on a phone, there is a drop down menu that contains the same elements that are in the bar across the top. There is not a scrolling effect that is in use on the website. 
            
            You can navigate around the website very easily. When you get to the menu, it is very organized with the different kinds of drinks or menu items that they sell. I would say that their website is easy to navigate. It may be somewhat simple, but very well done. 
            The colors used in the website are very nice and earthy. When I think of a coffee company, I think of earthy colors, so this is very fitting. They use white space effectively, but also use the earthy tones well. Within each section of the website, there is some sort of green that I feel really ties it all together with their branding. The color usage totally matches the product feeling and goes together very well. 
            As I mentioned with the colors, the usage of white space on this website is really nice. There is a great balance between the vibrant earthy colors and the white throughout the website. I really like how this website is able to look nice on the full computer screen, and on a phone screen as well. Within each section, there are buttons that you are able to hover over that will change to satisfying colors, and will take you to a different page where you could either order an item, or learn more about an offer. I really like this because it allows the main page to not be so overloading with information, leaving it with a modern look.

        <h2> <a href= "https://www.scheels.com/?msclkid=f2bb411ba22e1b4c74222602f225c35e&utm_source=bing&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=Branded_Exact&utm_term=Scheels&utm_content=Exact"> Scheels </a></h2>
        
        
        <p>
       I really like the Scheels website for multiple reasons. To begin with, I love the store, because they offer just about everything you could ever need in there. Their website has a very nice layout, making it very easy to use. The search bar is right at the top so it is very convenient to look for something specific. I really like that you have the ability to get to your account, find a store, and look at your cart all at the top. The icons that they use are a very nice touch.
            The coding of the website is very clean and modern. They are using HTML5 elements, most of the time div and script. I do not see that they are using tables, but they are using an element called iframe. 
            The layout does make sense to me and it is very easy to try and know where to go or look for certain things. There is sort of a lot going on on the page with lots of pictures and text, but it still makes sense in my opinion. It is laid out in sections as you scroll through the page. There is a scrolling effect where the top menu bar goes away as you scroll down, but returns to the screen as you scroll up. There is also a chat button that stays on your screen if you are in need of some customer service, which is very convenient.
            
            I would say that it is pretty easy to navigate around the menu and whole website in general. When looking at the screen, it may be a little overwhelming because it has a lot going on, but it is advertising a lot of different products. 
            
            The colors of the website are definitely a lot to look at on this website. I like that the main logo color is red, but when you scroll through the website and are looking at all of the different pictures it is a little too much for me. Granted, as you scroll, each of the pictures and the colors of the text are coordinated and go together well, but there are too many pictures that are used. 
            
            This website uses icons that represent what they lead to well. The shopping cart, person, and home make it obvious to people who are viewing this website where they are going when they click on the icons. On the buttons within the sections, there are rounded corners that give these buttons a really nice look to them instead of just a plain old sharp square. I like how they have a Christmas gift guide in their menu, because it is really targeting the right audience at this time of year and is very smart on their part.

       <h2> <a href="https://helena.craigslist.org/search/sss#search=1~gallery~0~0"> Craigslist </a></h2>
        <p>
       My least favorite website ever is Craigslist. I have always disliked this website and have never understanded why it is so bad. I don't really even like the logo, because it does not make sense to me. It looks really old school and is not a website that I would even trust to use these days. There's not very much going on that makes it appealing to look at. 
            
            The code does use HTML5 elements such as div and section, and script. The coding of the website is fine and up to date, and they do use tables. 
            
            The layout of the website does make sense to me, and how the listings are formatted makes sense. Where you have the ability to change your location to be closer to the items for sale is nice and it makes sense that it would be at the top. The search bar also being at the very top makes perfect sense to me, as well as the filter options. There is a scrolling effect where part of the top bar will go away as you scroll down. 
            
            It is pretty easy to navigate around as you can search easily, and filter for what exactly you are looking for easily. I would say that it is just okay because nothing important really stands out and every button you need to press just looks the same. 
            
            The colors that are used in this website are really boring. The purple that is in the logo is solely on the logo and nothing else. The blue tezt is inconsistent and weird. They use up too much white space and I think that makes the website look bad. They should definitely work on the colors that they are using, be consistent with it and use more of them to make this website much more interesting to look at. 
            
            As far as the little things go for this website, they don't do anything too crazy. On the listings, you are able to scroll through the photos without clicking and going into the entire listing. It is nice that they provide the price on the listing and they allow you to save the search or have favorite items, but it is definitely nothing too impressive when looking at this website.
