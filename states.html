    <h1> #1 Website - Arkansas<a href="https://portal.arkansas.gov/"></a></h1>
    <p>
    Out of the websites that we were assigned to analyze, my favorite website was definitely Arkansas. This was by far the most modern website and was very easy to navigate. The search bar was conveniently located at the top with the option to view frequently searched terms. The main page went through a slideshow of different things to look at which I felt was very helpful and handy. I really liked the color scheme on the website, as I feel blue is classic for a state website. The layout was very pleasing and I liked all of the menu options and placement. It was very easy to navigate through the entire website. I also liked how as you scrolled down there was news that was very updated. They also have a feature where you can ask any questions, which I felt was very helpful as well. Even on a smaller screen, I felt that this website still had the same appeal as the big screen.

    <h1> #2 Website - Kansas<a href="https://portal.kansas.gov/"></a></h1>
    <p> 
    Coming in second on the rankings is Kansas. This website is very similar to the Arkansas one, but feels a little bit more dated. The layout was also very similar, as was the color scheme. I didn't really like how the main option on the page as you opened it up was advertising about traveling to Kansas. I feel like that might not be the main reason that somebody would be interesting in looking at a state website. The pictures that they chose to use on the page were also not my favorite. Granted, this website was layed out well and I liked how it was easy to navigate.

    <h1> #3 Website - Maine<a href="https://www.maine.gov/portal/index.html"></a></h1>
    <p> 
    My third ranked website is Maine. It definitely feels a little bit more dated than the first two but i do like the color scheme, as it is the same as the first two websites. I liked the pictures that were chosen to use for the website and how it was very easy to get to wherever you wanted to go on the website. I liked how the menu opened on the left side and had all of the same options that were on the main page as well. I liked how they had a map feature that was able to help show where important things were around the state. As you scroll down to the bottom, it showed how many times the website had been visited in the past week, and I didn't think that was a necessary thing needed on this website.

    <h1> #4 Website - Alaska<a href="https://alaska.gov/"></a></h1>
    <p> 
    Coming in fourth on the ranking of these websites is Alaska. I liked the color scheme as it was close to the same as the other websites. The website just feels sort of old. The font of the text and the photos that they used at the bottom were not my favorite. I didn't really like how the menu expanded as you used the website on a bigger screen, I would prefer it to just be the same coming from the left. I liked how as you drug the mouse over the resident, business, and visitor options, there were more options that became available. However, I didn't really like how there was so much text and it was really busy.

    <h1> #5 Website - Maryland<a href="https://www.maryland.gov/Pages/default.aspx"></a></h1>
    <p>
    My least favorite of these websites is Maryland. The main reason being is the color scheme. I appreciate how they incorporated the state flag colors, but I just don't think that a state website should be red, because I liked the blue like the other websites. Idid like how there was a video subtly playing behind the main screen. The colors were just sort of loud when looking at the whole page that it was a little distracting to even think about what I wanted to explore on the website. I also didn't really like how pretty much everything you would want to look for on the website was on the menu that came from the right. I probably would like it better if the menu came from the left and if there were a couple more options on the main page.
